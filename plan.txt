Train.py:
- import files
- preprocessing
- iterate through the residue sequence:
   for all residues:
	predict structure
- refine predictions
- ranges

Residue features as vectors (angles, H-bonds, distances, ...)
	-> Train NNs
	
	
H-bonds as feature: 
	1. add missing hydrogen atoms (Lecture 8. Modeling of Proteins III)
	2. DSSP (Lecture 9. Protein Structure Prediction I)
	3. area diversity
